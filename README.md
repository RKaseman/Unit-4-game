# Unit-4-game - Crystal Collector

https://rkaseman.github.io/Unit-4-game/

This is refactored code. I added more media query sizes so it 
behaves better.

The fish are a processing.js sketch. They randomly generate shape 
and color and I'll figure out how to make it happen either on every 
click, or on game reset. For now it happens on page refresh only. I 
fixed screen sizing issues and learned the lesson that I need to 
consider my computer's characteristics when coding and sizing.

Don't let size get out of control!
