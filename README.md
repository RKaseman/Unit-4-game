# Unit-4-game - Crystal Collector

This was fun to tweak for the portfolio. The project should now be 
fully mobile responsive.

The fish are processing.js. They randomly generate shape and color 
and I'll figure out how to make it happen either on every click, or 
on game reset. For now it happens on page refresh only. I fixed 
screen sizing issues and learned the lesson that I need to consider 
my computer's characteristics when coding and sizing.

Don't let size get out of control!
