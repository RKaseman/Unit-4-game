[Something's Fishy: A Crystal Collector Game](https://rkaseman.github.io/unit-04-game-crystal-collector/)

[x] The computer randomly generates a number between 19-120
[x] Each fish is randomly worth 1-12 points
[x] No fish is worth the same amount of points
[x] The points are only known after a fish is clicked
[x] Keeps player score
- - if the player matches the computer total it's a win
- - if the player goes over the computer total it's a loss
[x] When a round is over the game resets

- Browser-based interactive game
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- processing.js

I incorporate [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) in my projects whenever I can.

After research and refactoring, the game now looks and behaves like I envisioned in the beginning. The fish randomize appearance when they're clicked. I cleaned up more of the code, and it's mobile responsive.
