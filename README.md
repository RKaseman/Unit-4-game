I incorporate [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) in my projects whenever I can. In this case, the animated fish.

I added a moving gradient color effect to the header and restyled it somewhat from what I turned in for class.

After research and refactoring, the game now looks and behaves like I envisioned in the beginning. The fish randomize appearance when they're clicked. I cleaned up the code, and it's mobile responsive.
