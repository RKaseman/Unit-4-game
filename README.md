# Unit-4-game

I was right! This was fun to tweak. This project should now be fully 
mobile responsive (I think...I never know until I know).

I'm way prouder of this submission than the last homework. Once 
again, I know there has to be something wrong with it, but tweaks 
to this project will be fun. The fish randomly generate shape and 
color and I'd like to find a way to add that to a reset. For now it 
happens on page refresh only. And I need to figure out the best 
screen sizing. It's too big and I need to consider my computer's 
characteristics when coding and sizing.
