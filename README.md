I incorporate [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) in my projects whenever I can. In this case, the animated fish.

The moving gradient color effect of the header is pure **CSS** and the whole game was restyled somewhat from how it originally looked.

After research and refactoring, the game now looks and behaves like I envisioned in the beginning. The fish randomize appearance when they're clicked. I cleaned up the code, and it's mobile responsive.
